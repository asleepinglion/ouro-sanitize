#SuperJS Sanitize

> **Disclaimer:** SuperJS is under heavy development at the moment, and breaking changes are likely. The intent is
to publish a stable release during the first quarter of 2015.

Sanitizations modify values to make sure they conform to the expected format, for example, the `toLowerCase`. In addition to
the sanitizations, the library provides a mechanism to setup and process a group of sanitizations
using the bluebird Promise Library.
